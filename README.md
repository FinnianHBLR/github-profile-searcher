>Features
* Search GitHub users
* Display repositories
* Sort repositories
* Show user info
* Show user profile picture
* Dark/Light mode

> Notes:
* I am aware of higher order components for React and I will use them for next time I do dark/light mode applications.
* I tried to save the state of theme, and it worked but the background color did not want to update properly. This is why the feature was removed.
